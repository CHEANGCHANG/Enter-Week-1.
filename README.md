Tree Species Identification Project This project helps people identify different tree species just by using images of leaves, bark, or the whole tree. Using AI and image recognition, it can quickly tell you what kind of tree you're looking at. Itâ€™s perfect for nature lovers, students, or anyone curious about trees around them.
